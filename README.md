Automaton Registry
==================

`Indigo United 2013`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This task is used to maintain a registry file with some curated info about the
tasks that the community can use in automaton.

## Curated information

In order to achieve an additional quality, the automaton team curates the
task ecosystem.

### Official tasks

These are essentially tasks that have either been developed by the core team.

### Recommended tasks

Tasks that, after some testing, and feedback from the community, have become a
sort of *de-facto* task for a specific purpose. These tasks will have a higher
rank when searching.

We're always looking out for quality tasks, so if you have released something,
it's likely we already know about it. Still, if you would like to apply your
task to be reviewed more thoroughly, feel free to contact us at
automaton@indigounited.com.

### Blacklisted tasks

In order to protect the community for either poor quality tasks, or
ill-intentioned software, blacklisted tasks won't show up in the search results.

If you believe your task has been blacklisted by mistake, or would like to
understand why that happened, feel free to contact us at
automaton@indigounited.com.
